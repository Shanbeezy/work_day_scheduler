# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am - 5pm). It is also color coded so that the user can easily recognize events based on past, present, and future. Past events will be light grey in color, while present events will be orange and future events will be light green. This app runs in the browser and also features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
